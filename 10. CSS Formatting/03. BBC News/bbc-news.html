                    One of Germany's most senior banking regulators has warned London that it is likely to lose its role
                    as "the gateway to Europe" for vital financial services. Dr Andreas Dombret, executive board member
                    for the German central bank, the Bundesbank, said that even if banking rules were "equivalent"
                    between the UK and the rest of the European Union, that was "miles away from access to the single
                    market".
